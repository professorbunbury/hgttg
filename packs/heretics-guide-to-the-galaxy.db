At full speed, teeks look nothing more than a blur, and can often do tasks in mere seconds.</p><h2>Society and Culture</h2><p>Teeks are widely known as expert scavengers. They love trinkets, and often scavenge and steal various objects from animal nests, and occasionally from ewok villages as well, which they hoard together, hidden from outsiders. Teeks, however, do not feel as if they are thieves—they always leave a trinket or token behind that they feel is of similar or equal value to whatever they take. The original owners of whatever was taken, however, are rarely happy with the trade—teeks value certain items that others might not. Ewoks think of them as a plague, and feel that even seeing a teek is extremely bad luck. For these reasons, teeks are generally avoided, and keep to themselves. Teeks are never considered prey in the jungles, due to their extreme speed, which they use both to escape from predators and to flee from the angry victims of their thievery. They are generally afraid of outsiders, and often hide from them; though, after some time of basic contact with them, teeks usually manage to overcome their initial fear.</p><h2>Names</h2><p>Teek names are very similar to each other.

The large eyes of the advozsec are adaptations to the clouds of volcanic ash which darken Riflor's skies.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Since so much of the sunlight on Riflor is blocked by volcanic eruptions, advozsec tend to settle near geothermal springs for heat. Unfortunately, these springs also tend to be in geologically unstable regions, and anything built near them is often destroyed or abandoned due to eruptions or groundquakes. As a result, the advozse people ended up having little attachment to material goods or long-term plans, and developed a pessimistic, selfish, and even paranoid outlook on life. This facet of their culture remained long after contact with the Galactic Republic gave them access to modern construction techniques allowing for more permanent buildings. Seeing financial stability as the only truly achievable stability one could find in life, the advozsec constantly strive to accumulate as much monetary wealth as they can in a lifetime in order to have the ability to rebuild when the worst happens.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Advozsec have simple names that do not distinguish between genders, using familiar surnames.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>First Names.</strong> Dleck, Fjemm, Gorde, Rollar, Xon</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Surnames.</strong> Ghantere, Leventraim, Timack, Vy, Zimda</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"traits":{"value":"<p><em><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong></em> Your Constitution score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Age.</strong></em> Advozsec reach adulthood in their late teens and typically live for over half a century.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Alignment.</strong></em> Advozsec's paranoid and pessimistic nature causes them to tend towards balanced alignments, particularly lawful balanced, though there are exceptions.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Size.</strong></em> Advozsec typically stand 5 to 6 feet tall and generally weigh about 130 lbs.

Males are dominant in coway society and each village is ruled by a triumvirate of chiefs who answer only to the will of Canu, a warrior god. If the chiefs encounter gridlock when they attempt to resolve an issue by themselves, they submit the problem to Canu.

The gigorans evolved from group-oriented primates who lived in caves. As they developed intelligence, they took to living as hunter-gatherers while keeping their cavern homes. The species divides itself into home-clans made up of around 50 members who divide themselves into three to five family groups. There is no higher government than the home-clan on Gigor, each under the leadership of the most skillful hunter. Gigorans are fiercely loyal to these familial home-clans, as well as extremely protective. This dedication to family often carries over to their close friends, being equally protective over them.

In contrast to Altor 14's other natives, the predatory avogwi, the nuiwit are strictly herbivorous. Nuiwit have evolved adaptations to escape predators like the avogwi, such as bulging eyes which give them 360 degree vision, and a tail that can be detached if grasped by a predator. (A detached tail can be regrown after about four weeks.) Nuiwit are cold-blooded, limiting their activities to the morning and twilight hours when the temperature is moderate.

With more extensive contacts in the outside galaxy post-discovery, and relatively advanced technology, it would be simple for the nuiwit to conquer or even exterminate the avogwi. However, the nuiwit are strictly pacifistic, horrified by any kind of violence. As a result, they are content to wait until the avogwi are driven away by the ever-expanding nuiwit settlements and farms. This pacifism shapes every part of their society, including their politics.

Even during multiple Galactic Civil Wars, they still were completely unaware that starships traveled in space over Dantooine. They have not developed agriculture as a means of subsistence, nor have they discovered the secret of metallurgy. The dantari spend their lives wandering across the plains searching for food, using simple weapons such as stone axes and spears to hunt animals. Usually, they will establish a temporary village at the end of each day and subsequently fold up their tents every morning before continuing their endless journey. Those villages are made of simple, animal-skin shelters, with multiple campfires in front of them. Although they do not have a king or a chief, one particular individual is regarded as an authority of special importance by their peers: the garoo. A highly respected member of the tribe, the garoo is a cross between a priest and a sorcerer. He is thought to be capable of commanding the animal spirits, and the dantari say that a garoo never lies. The dantari have an extensive knowledge of the medicinal properties of the local flora and fauna.

As such, they continue to live in large speeders or other portable homes, and they prefer to take their jobs with them, making seasonal migrations back and forth. This tendency for travel has also made them a prominent sight in the spacelanes, and many enjoy tourism as a hobby.

They are gangly with sharp claws and thin, expressive, tufted tails. They are excellent climbers. Members of the species are covered in dull-looking fur. Most of a dulok's fur is relatively uniform in length except for a longer shock atop the head. The features of a dulok's broad face are screwed up into a constant scowl. A full set of teeth filled the mouth, and the two sharp canines jut from their lower jaw. Dulok eyes are sensitive to bright light, but in low-light conditions, their pupils narrow to vertical slits. While they groom themselves using the materials available to them, such as stolen ewok soap, euloks have a hard time keeping clean. As a result, their fur often becomes mangy, unkempt, foul smelling, and infested with parasitic insects.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Although ewoks and duloks speak mutually intelligible dialects and acknowledge a common heritage, their interactions are seldom cordial. The duloks hate and envy the ewoks for enjoying what the duloks see as the better lifestyle in the bountiful forests. Most eke out a living in marshlands, based in villages of caves, logs, and stumps. While they rarely show the pluck and flair so often attributed to their forest cousins, duloks excel at fighting, raiding, and stealing.

Every noehon has a pair of scent glands, one of each side of their mouth, which produce a strong, musky scent. Each has a unique scent, which they use to mark possessions, territory, and their subordinates. The scent is difficult to remove.

Welds are ruled by a single dominant \"alpha\" male, their \"harem\" of females treated as commodities, with excess females traded to other welds for technology or valuables. Adolescent males in the weld are driven off by the alpha as soon as they come of age. Elderly leaders will usually be killed by younger males, who then take control of the weld.

Yar Togna is a foul-smelling, high-gravity planet with a toxic, fume-saturated atmosphere. As a result, tognath wear a breathing apparatus to process the oxygen content in a planet's atmosphere. The tognath have a striking look thanks to their insectoid and mammalian characteristics; another factor is their having both an endo- and exoskeleton. They also possess a very primitive nervous system, which provides them with immunity to most pain (a helpful trait in combat). Tognath begin life as larvae born from egg clutches hatched in a suspension jelly, and latch onto one of their parents, feeding directly from their bloodstream. While in that jelly, two or more eggs (not necessarily from the same parent) sometimes graft together, thus creating a bond that continues throughout the life of the eggmates. Six months later, parents visit a nursery tree, where the young detatch from them and spin a cocoon. Within, the offspring undergo a metamorphosis, developing both their skeletons to resist the high gravity and pressures of Yar Togna.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Tognath live in stilted homes with lava channels near the main mountain range of Yar Togna, where they have access to mountain springwater. Most of tognath society believes that mate selection and egg laying should occur late in life, after having dedicated most of one's prime years to a career.

They coexist symbiotically with the fungi: a family of xamsters bind themselves to a particular type of fungus known as a malvil-tree and treat it like a beloved pet or even a member of the family. The reptiles give their own malvil-tree a name and tend to its growth and feeding. In return, the tree permits the xamsters to take up residence inside it and obey simple commands, like raising or lowering its branches to afford the caretaker a better look at the surrounding terrain. Most importantly, the family is able to harvest the tree's spores. They can use these fungal products for diverse tasks. For example, certain spores can be used to coat someone's eyes, granting the ability to peer through the fog of spores that shrouds the surface of Xagobah. These spores also grant safe passage through the forest to those who coat themselves in it; otherwise, other hungry trees might mistake the traveler for a meal. Xamsters know of many useful fungi, including Xabar, which can be used to make a potent form of spice with the power to paralyze the user.

These can be used in combat to impale an opponent or during a wrath-driven charge. Some cragmoloids have two big tusks, while others have four smaller ones.

Duplicity and deception commonly exasperates cragmoloids, who are prone to violent attacks of rage when angered. Notwithstanding their physical prowess, cragmoloids believe that unjustified violence is barbaric and to be avoided. Their civilization is organized into clans. Cragmoloids are so close to their families that they suffer severe depressions if separated from their homes or their friends.

Few dybrinthe leave their homeworld, though most of those who do are scientists drawn from the engineering castes, as technological professions are the highest in demand on nearby worlds.

Originally dresselians were simple hunters, but two centuries later, they'd evolved into a burgeoning industrial-level society with a loose coalition government, often in contact with the bothans, who decided to leave the natives low-tech alone. Dressel's isolation ended after the Galactic Empire took control of the system, the Imperials descending on the planet, moving to set up bases and exploit Dressel's natural resources. The dressellians, despite having only a loose political organization and barely industrial-level technology, formed a resistance movement. At first, their resistance had limited effect, but over time, dressellians became masters of guerrilla warfare, making the continued occupation of Dressel very costly for the Empire. Later, the bothans supplied the resistance with weapons, and mercenaries to train the dressellians. In the end, the Imperials decided the occupation was not worth the cost, and abandoned Dressel. The Imperials made a lasting impression, dressellians generally wary of \"outlanders,\" besides the bothans, who they hold in high regard given their shared history of peace.

While their society and speech are considered primitive by galactic standards, their innate talent with technology rivals the top minds of the galaxy. From bits of scavenged electronics and equipment, the gormak construct advanced tools, heavy machinery, specialized weapons and even cybernetic implants. However, despite their incredible affinity for technology, the gormak remain a pre-spaceflight culture confined to their homeworld, which causes them to be viewed as a backward species despite being perfectly capable of repairing, modifying and improving tech created by more advanced cultures.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Gormak are commonly named after heroes of their history by local shamans.

They often use their ceaseless, loud laughter to scare off any potential attackers. They travel in groups, making as much noise as possible in an attempt to intimidate other creatures in the jungles. After finding a corpse, monkey-lizards spend time fighting over the food instead of sharing it. Kowakians are known to be extremely cruel and mean-spirited to both other monkey-lizards and to members of other species. They have a clear sense of mischief and humor, and are known to mock others, laugh at them, and even fling objects towards them simply because they find it amusing.

They are immune to the effects of aging, and demonstrate the ability to rapidly regenerate injuries. The talortai are known to be Force-sensitive, able to distinguish between the light and dark sides of the Force, in addition to the ability to detect its presence.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>The talortai are a proud race of warriors from the Outer Rim planet of Talor Minor. From a young age, talortai are taught in the ways of traditional combat and honor by special trainers on their homeworld. Talortai born offworld are most often instructed by their parents, or sometimes trainers hired by the parents, to preserve that warrior tradition. Talortai culture is dedicated to the completion of personal \"conquests\" in life, each talortai having to overcome their own personal battle, feeling that special sense of accomplishment being the main goal of most talortai before they die. While most talortai accomplish this by participating in battles and wars that matter to them, others' \"conquests\" can be something as simple as protecting a loved one. The talortai's sense of honor dictates most aspects of their life.
